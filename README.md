## What are dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files on Unix-based systems. At first they are just hidden configuration files of the system (that's why the reason for starting with `.`). However, we can use them to make it easier to configure our computers, with many advantages:

- Easy to format a new computer
- Automation of tasks
- Easy maintenance
- Storage in remote locations (GitHub, Dropbox, etc)
- Versioning
- Import to multiple computers
- Customize the terminal

## Features

_Check linked files to more details._

### Installation files

- [apps.sh][] - installs _Homebrew_, _Homebrew Cask Upgrade_ and some _apps_.
- [dock.sh][] - macOS Dock items customization.
- [dotfiles.sh][] - _Oh My Zsh_ installer, _.zshrc_ and _git_ configs.
- [hostname.sh][] - change _hostname_ (MacBook name).
- [macos.sh][] - macOS defaults configs.
- [npm.sh][] - install _npm_ packages.
- [setup.sh][] - main installer.
- [ssh.sh][] - generate _SSH_.
- [util.sh][] - support functions for other installers.

**Note:** _These files will be discarded later._

### Settings Files

- [.gitconfig][] - basic _git_ settings.
- [.gitignore_global][] - global _gitignore_.
- [.zshrc][] - terminal configs with aliases, paths, plugins and theme.
- [com.googlecode.iterm2.plist][] - [iTerm2][] settings.
- [starship.toml][] - [Starship][] theme settings.

**Note:** _These files are permanent_.

## Installation

```bash
git clone -b personal https://github.com/samuelramox/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles

./install/setup.sh
```

**Note:** For hardware with an Intel processor use the [v3.7][] release.
**Note:** You can also download a specific [release][].

### Explaining the process

The [setup.sh][] process will ask if you want to install the following scripts, in this order:

- [apps.sh][] - install _Homebrew_, _Homebrew Cask Upgrade_ and applications.
  I suggest you comment apps that should not be installed and include those that are not listed. This script will install in the following order:

  - Install [Homebrew][].
  - Homebrew formulas: [curl][], [Git][], [iTermocil][], [Nano][], [Node][], [nvm][], [PostgreSQL][], [pyenv][], [Python][], [Ruby][], [Tree][], [Yarn][], [Zsh][].
  - Homebrew taps: [homebrew/fonts][], [homebrew/drivers][], [homebrew/versions][], [homebrew/command-not-found][].
  - Homebrew casks: [Adguard][], [Dash][], [Google Chrome][], [IINA][], [iStat Menus][], [iTerm2][], [JetBrains Mono][], [Paw][], [PDF Expert][], [qBittorrent][], [Sip][] and [Visual Studio Code][].
  - Install [Homebrew Cask Upgrade][].

- [dotfiles.sh][] - install [Oh My Zsh][], some Zsh plugins, [Starship][] theme and set _iTerm2_ preferences (including [Dracula Theme][]). This step also opens [.gitconfig][] so that the user can put his data.
- [npm.sh][] - install some npm packages.
- [macos.sh][] - set custom macOS preferences.
- [dock.sh][] - install [dockutil][] and set custom permanent apps in Dock. _Finder_ and _Recycle Bin_ are already permanent (unless you change this).
- [ssh.sh][] - Generate _SSH_.
- [hostname.sh][] - Update _hostname_ (MacBook name).
- Create a directory called _Developer_ in _Home_ directory for projects and development.
- Cleanup cached downloads and remove the installation zip and folder.

**Note:** I suggest you read these files and turn your preferences on/off before installation.

## Manual setup

[iTerm2][] settings are changed by [dotfiles.sh][] and it will look the same as [screenshot][], but you can change them manually if you prefer. My [Visual Studio Code][] settings are loaded by the [Settings Sync][], so you will have to change manually or load your settings.

### iTerm2 - Change the color theme

You can use the default theme or switch to your preferred theme. I use [Dracula Theme][].

`iTerm2 → Preferences → Profiles → Colors → Color presets`

### iTerm2 - Change font

You can use the default font or switch to your preferred font. I use [JetBrains Mono][] with 12px.

`iTerm2 → Preferences → Profiles → Text → Change Font`

### iTerm2 - Enable word jumps and word deletion, aka natural text selection

By default, word jumps (`option` + `→` or `←`) and word deletions (`option` + `backspace`) do not work.

`iTerm2 → Preferences → Profiles → Keys → Load Preset... → Natural Text Editing`

### Visual Studio Code - Config

`Code → Preference → Settings (or CMD + ,) and add or edit the following values:`

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.fontSize": 12,
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"terminal.integrated.fontSize": 12,
```

### Visual Studio Code - Configurable External Terminal

If you are using [iTerm2][] as a default terminal, you need to configure this in [Visual Studio Code][].

`Code → Preference → Settings (or CMD + ,) and add or edit the following values:`

```json
"terminal.external.osxExec": "iTerm.app",
```
