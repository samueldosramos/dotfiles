## What are dotfiles

Dotfiles are configuration files on Unix-based systems. At first they are just hidden configuration files of the system (that's why the reason for starting with "."). However, we can use them to make it easier to configure our computers, with many advantages:

- Easy to format a new computer;
- Automation of tasks;
- Easy maintenance;
- Storage in remote locations (GitHub, Dropbox, etc);
- Versioning;
- Import to multiple computers;
- Customize the terminal.

## Features

## Installation:

```
git clone -b personal https://github.com/samuelramox/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles

./install/setup.sh
```

**Note:** You can also download a specific [release](https://github.com/samuelramox/dotfiles/releases).

### Explaining the process

The [setup.sh](install/setup.sh) process will ask if you want to install the following scripts, in this order:
**Note:** I suggest you read these files and turn your preferences on/off before installation.

- [apps.sh](install/apps.sh) - install _Homebrew_, _Homebrew Cask Upgrade_ and applications.
  I suggest you comment apps that should not be installed and include those that are not listed. This script will install in the following order:

  - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/);
  - Homebrew formulas: [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org), [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [Python](https://www.python.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Unrar](https://www.rarlab.com/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org);
  - Homebrew taps: [homebrew/fonts](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-fonts), [homebrew/drivers](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-drivers), [homebrew/versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask-versions), [homebrew/command-not-found](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-command-not-found);
  - Homebrew casks: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [IINA](https://iina.io/), [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com), [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono), [Postman](https://www.postman.com), [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com);
  - Install [Homebrew Cask Upgrade](https://github.com/buo/homebrew-cask-upgrade);

- [dotfiles.sh](install/dotfiles.sh) - install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), some Zsh plugins, [Spaceship ZSH](https://denysdovhan.com/spaceship-prompt/) theme and set _iTerm2_ preferences. This step also opens [gitconfig](.gitconfig) so that the user can put his data.
- [npm.sh](install/npm.sh) - install some npm packages.
- [python.sh](install/python.sh) - install some Python packages.
- [macos.sh](install/macos.sh) - set custom macOS preferences.
- [dock.sh](install/dock.sh) - install [dockutil](https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil) and set custom permanent apps in Dock. _Finder_ and _Recycle Bin_ are already permanent (unless you change this).
- Generate _SSH_.
- Update _hostname_ (MacBook name).
- Create a directory called _Developer_ in _Home_ directory for projects and development.
- Cleanup cached downloads and remove the installation zip and folder.

## Manual setup

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) settings are changed by [dotfiles.sh](install/dotfiles.sh), but you can change them manually if you prefer. My [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) settings are loaded by the [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) extension, so you will have to change manually or load your settings.

### iTerm2 - Change the color theme:

iTerm → Preferences → Profiles → Colors → Color presets. I use [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) theme.

### iTerm2 - Change font:

iTerm → Preferences → Profiles → Text → Change Font. I use [JetBrains Mono](https://jetbrains.com/mono) with 13px.

### iTerm2 - Enable word jumps and word deletion, aka natural text selection:

By default, word jumps (option + → or ←) and word deletions (option + backspace) do not work. To enable these, go to: iTerm → Preferences → Profiles → Keys → Load Preset... → Natural Text Editing

### Visual Studio Code config:

Code → Preference → Settings (or CMD + ,) and add or edit the following values:

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
"editor.fontSize": 13,
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"terminal.integrated.fontSize": 13,
```
